//Some cases to explore: 
//- when the size delta is less than the min trade size?
//- given the account won't meet the margin requirements
//- given there is no pending market order

//- when the user tries to open a trade an he already has pending trades?

//* some cases may be not in the function logic, but still could make sense to be there
