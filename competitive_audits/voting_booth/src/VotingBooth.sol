//
// This contract is a simplified version of a real contract which
// was audited by Cyfrin in a private audit and contained the same bug.
//
// Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find that bug!
//
// This contract allows the creator to invite a select group of people
// to vote on something and provides an eth reward to the `for` voters
// if the proposal passes, otherwise refunds the reward to the creator.
// The creator of the contract is considered "Trusted".
//
// This contract has been intentionally simplified to remove much of
// the extra complexity in order to help you find the particular bug without
// other distractions. Please read the comments carefully as they note
// specific findings that are excluded as the implementation has been
// purposefully kept simple to help you focus on finding the harder
// to find and more interesting bug.
//
// This contract intentionally has no time-out period for the voting
// to complete; lack of a time-out period resulting in voting never
// completing is not a valid finding as this has been intentionally
// omitted to simplify the codebase.
//
// This contract should only contain 1 intentional High finding, but
// if you find others they were not intentional :-) This contract should
// not be used in any live/production environment; it is purely an
// educational bug-hunting exercise based on a real-world example.
